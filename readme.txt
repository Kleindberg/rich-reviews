== Installation ==

1. You can download and install the Rich Reviews plugin through the built-in Wordpress plugin installer. Alternately, download the zip file and upload the '/rich-reviews/' folder to your '../wp-content/plugins/' folder.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the shortcodes [RICH_REVIEWS_FORM], [RICH_REVIEWS_SHOW], [RICH_REVIEWS_SHOW_ALL], and [RICH_REVIEWS_SNIPPET] as described in the Rich Reviews settings page within a page, a post, or a widget area.
4. Periodically check the Rich Reviews menu in the Wordpress control panel to see if there are any pending reviews which need to be approved (or deleted).

== Screenshots ==

1. Show some or all of the reviews that you have approved to be shown on your site.
2. A simple review submission form can be placed anywhere on your site, and will not be displayed publicly until YOU give it the okay. An admin menu lets you choose which reviews are real and which are spam.
3. A simple shortcode allows you to post an aggregate review score on any page, which means that Google will display a star-rating whenever your page comes up in a search.
